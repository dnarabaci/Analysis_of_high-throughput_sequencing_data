# Analysis_of_high-throughput_sequencing_data
Several scripts that I have used to analyse high throughput sequencing data on university high performance cluster (HPC)

There are currently 3 parts:
3 - Data Preprocessing
4 - Genome Assembly
5 - Mapping and Variant Calling

Each part contains the relevant bash scripts, as well as a jupyter notebook for theoretical exercises.
