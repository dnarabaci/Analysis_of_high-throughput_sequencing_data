# Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data
Several scripts that I have used to analyse high throughput sequencing data on university high performance cluster (HPC).

There are currently 3 parts:
- 3 - Data Preprocessing
- 4 - Genome Assembly
- 5 - Mapping and Variant Calling

Each part contains the relevant bash scripts, as well as a jupyter notebook for theoretical exercises.
