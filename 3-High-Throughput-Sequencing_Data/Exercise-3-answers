Exercise 3.1.1 Sequencing data formats
1. What is the output of a Sanger sequencing run?
	Output of a Sanger run is a chromatogram with a series of different colored peaks, each color representing a nucleotide. 
2. How is this output usually presented in the end?
	AB files can be converted fo fasta, fastq, txt files.
3. List at least three common sequencing data formats?
	fasta, fastq, sam/bam, vcf

Exercise 3.1.2 The fastq format
Have a look at the sequencing files listed in Table 3.1. Those are from Illumina whole genome
sequencing. You may find them somewhere in the DATA folder in the home root on the server.
Try to understand the file format by answering the following questions. These Websites may be
helpful: http://maq.sourceforge.net/fastq.shtml, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ format.
1. How to find the files in the DATA folder? Remember the Shell session!
	find . -name DNA1_1.fq.gz -print
2. How to best visualize the files not to waste too many resources?
	zcat <filename> | less
3. Describe the structure of the file.
	fastq file format: @<sequence identifier with info about run and cluster>\n <sequence base calls> \n +
	 <base call quality scores in Phred +33 encoded format, using ascii characters to represent numerical quality scores>
4. What are the meanings of the different lines?
	labels, sequences and quality scores are each on different lines, then new reads start.
5. What are base qualities? How are they represented? Which encoding is used here?
	Base qualities represent the confidence or probability of that base being correct in a sequencing read. They are represented
	with ASCII characters in fastq files. Here Phred33 is used.
6. How to identify read pairs?
	Paired end reads are in separate files, same name but with either a _1 or _2 at the end.

Exercise 3.1.3 Estimate genome coverage
The genome size for Capsella rubella is estimated at 250 Mb, the one for Capsella grandiflora
at 270 Mb.
1. How long is one sequencing read?
	120 bp
	zcat Capsella-sequencing/DNA-seq/rawdata/DNA1_1.fq.gz | awk 'NR==2 {print length($0); exit}'	
2. How many reads are there for each species?
	zcat Capsella-sequencing/DNA-seq/rawdata/DNA1_1.fq.gz | grep -c @
	35683508*2 for forward and backward reads for C. grandiflora (DNA1_1.fq.gz and DNA1_2.fq.gz). 
	Then another set of reads are in DNA3_1 and DNA3_2 files (36470705*2).
3. How many bases are there for each species?
4. Calculate the average genome coverage for both species.
	(35683508*2+36470705*2)*120/(270*10^6) = 64.14X
	<number of reads>*<length of each read>/<length of genome>
5. There is a way to estimate genome coverage using sequencing data without any additional
information. Which one? Try it out? What difficulties can you get?
	using the formula for theoretical calculation.

Exercise 3.2.1 Quality control
Run the FastQC tool, you may download it at the following website,
https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/.
1. Evaluate the quality of these sequencing runs. Is everything allright?
	Per base sequence quality and per tile sequence quality is low.
2. Explore the different analysis modules and discuss possible issues. Read the
documentation for better understanding.
	We expect a drop in quality scores on the 3' ends as sequencing proceeds due to fluorophore degrading,
	and some strands in cluster not being elongated.
3. Find some other tools to do quality assessments, try out at least one of it. A good
starting point would be your your favorite search engine, Pubmed or the seqanswers.com
community (Li et al., 2011).
	qualimap, seqkit, fastp, prinse

Exercise 3.2.2 Quality trimming
Download the Trimmomatic tool (Bolger et al., 2014) from the following website,
http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic.
1. What does Trimmomatic do?
	It’s a tool for trimming and cropping fastq formatted Illumina data, as well as remove adapter sequences. It improves overall quality of reads.
2. Choose the appropriate parameters and run the program for all four Capsella datasets.
3. Find other tools doing quality trimming.
	seqtk, cutadapt, fastp, sickle, bbduk
4. Evaluate the quality of the trimmed dataset. What’s different?
	Per base sequence quality increased while the sequences got shorter. We sacrificed some sequences to improve quality.

Exercise 3.2.3 Fastq file transformations
Sanger quality encoding is again standard right now.
1. Identify at least one tool to transform quality encodings.
	seqtk
2. Transform all dataset not having Sanger quality encoding.
3. Extract the first 1000 entries from each fastq file and save in fasta format.

Exercise 3.2.4 Error correction
Have a look at the following review by Yang et al. (2012) about error-correction methods for
next-generation sequencing.
1. What kind of sequencing errors are described there?
	substitutions, insertions and deletions
2. What is the general approach taxen to do error-correction?
	In haplotype sequencing, rare errors can be corrected by overlaying all reads of each position, and errors can be corrected via majority vote.
3. Identify a more recent review. Are there any conceptual updates?
In the past decade, machine learning and neural networks have been implemented to wrestle with the issues, along with betterment of sequencing methods.
4. Identify at least one error-correction tool to be used with our data.
	bcf, quake 
5. Do error correction with our data. Get organized with your colleaguse to try out different
tools on different data sets.
6. Evaluate the quality of the error corrected datasets

Exercise 3.2.6 Data repositories
1. How do people usually handle high-throughput sequencing data for long term archival?
	 data curation, metadata and standardization, public repos, database collaborations
2. How to access archived data?
	through the database website like NCBI, GEO using accession numbers
3. Can you find the Capsella data we used in some public repository? Where?
	In NCBI https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/ERX4410817
	
Exercise 3.2.7 Data from different technologies
1. Identify where to get the rawdata for the study presented by Michael et al. (2018).
	In ENA https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB21270
2. What sequencing technologies were used here? And for what purpose?
	Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing, Illumina sequencing for pilon polishing?, 
	validate the contiguity and quality of the assembly with two independent single-molecule technologies,
	 Bionano optical genome maps and Pacific Biosciences Sequel sequencing
3. Download the data and explore it. What formats do you get?
	fastq, fast5
4. What further pre-processing steps can you suggest?
	Trimming, adapter removal, filtering
